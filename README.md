# duffing_oscillator
A non-linear oscillator with a driving force and frictional force acting on it exhibits chaos.

- The Duffing Oscillator is a very famous non-linear oscillator used to study chaos. [More Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffing_equation)
- The potential looks like a smooth W, with two stable equilibrium points and one unstable equilibrium point between them.
- As the system is one-dimensional, the phase space (or configuration space, for our present discussion) has two parametrs, x, and the derivative of x, with respect to time.
- For different values of x and xdot, the particle damps and down and settles into one of the two stable points.
- Due to the chaotic nature of the system, very slight variations in the values of position and velocity (assuming configuration space and not phase space) make the particle settle intoo a different stable point.
